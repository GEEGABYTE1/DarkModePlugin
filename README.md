# Use and Access

The native implementation is with two tabs (a landing and settings page) with an integrated Color Class. The Color Class can be manipulated and integrated in other Views (to change background depending on different events) and does not **have** to be under any of the TabViews - the TabViews are just for **demonstration**. 

Moreover, the current implementation does use the `@AppStorage` wrapper to save background data of the local process.
